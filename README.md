A simple rock paper scissors game, fun for the whole family!


In order to improve the game, I would add a delay between rounds so that the player is prompted to put in an input. The computer would cycle through its options before it actually made its choice. It would be more obvious to the player how they lost, tied, or won. Overall though, still a triple A game worth about $60 retail.

I did not follow The Odin Project's project description perfectly here; for example my game runs infinitely. I think that is okay though, as I thought the market was saturated and there was some room for creative freedom in expressing this game's unique identity.
