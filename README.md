A simple rock paper scissors game, fun for the whole family!


In order to improve the game, I would add a delay between rounds so that the player is prompted to put in an input. The computer would cycle through its options before it actually made its choice. It would be more obvious to the player how they lost, tied, or won. Overall though, still a triple A game worth about $60 retail.
